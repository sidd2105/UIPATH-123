# Workflow-Inspector
A tool for evaluating UiPath Studio projects according to the best practices of workflow development.

## How to collaborate
This project welcomes the creation of new checks and other improvements to the tool.
Before making a pull request, please make sure of the following:
- Confirm that the project can be open and executed by UiPath Studio 2018.2.6
- New checks should follow the style of existing ones
- Workflows that implement new checks should pass the existing checks
- Add a clear explanation of the check in the Checklist file
- If a check is not universally applicable to all RPA projects, it should be added as a Custom check and be set by default to OFF in the Checklist file
- Add your name as the author of the check as well as a form of contact (like your GitHub profile page)
